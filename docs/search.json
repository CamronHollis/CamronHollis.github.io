Generative Art Review\nThis generative art is produced by Adobe using a ‘Generative Fill’ tool.

This chart was criticized on its publication in 2014 for confusing people by having the line going down when it was really depicting an increase in gun deaths: At first glance, one might take away that gun murders had gone down in Florida after the passage of the Stand Your Ground law, while in fact the opposite is true. The creators of the graph defended themselves by claiming it was stylized after dripping blood, evocative of the deaths caused by gun violence. If that was their aim, they didn’t really commit. For example, if they made upside down bars instead of a line, it would have looked better.\nThe dripping blood aesthetic is not the only criticism of that can be made of the graph. The time axis is badly depicted, where it is harder to tell which dot is attached to which year, besides from the clearly labeled 2005. It is also not clear why the first and last point has a labeled death value, but no other point. The range of values is also much more narrow than the chart because the authors decided to include 0 and 1000, a choice I assume was to expand the amount of red headroom for their blood aesthetic.\nThe font and color choices are fine, although the big block of red makes the chart hart to look at for long period."
